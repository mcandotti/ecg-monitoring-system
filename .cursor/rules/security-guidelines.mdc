# Security Guidelines

This project deals with sensitive medical data and follows strict security practices.

## Patient Data Protection
- Patient identifiable data is protected using encryption/encoding methods in [web/config/security.php](mdc:web/config/security.php)
- Names and security numbers are both hashed and encoded
- Use the existing security functions for any new sensitive data

## Authentication System
- Authentication system is defined in [web/includes/auth.php](mdc:web/includes/auth.php)
- Three user roles: admin, medecin (doctor), patient
- Password hashing is used for secure storage
- Remember-me tokens are implemented with secure expiration

## Environment Variables
- Environmental configuration handled in [web/config/env.php](mdc:web/config/env.php)
- Sensitive values like database credentials and hash keys should be set via environment variables
- Default values are provided in docker-compose.yml but should be overridden in production

## Best Practices
- Always validate user input
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database operations
- Keep sensitive data encrypted or hashed as appropriate
